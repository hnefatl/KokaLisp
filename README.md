# KokaLisp
Very basic implementation of a lisp-like language interpreter in [Koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka), to play around with the language.

See [test.kk](test.kk) for some examples of syntax, but it's a fairly unexciting and unambitious dialect of lisp: the main focus is experimenting with Koka.

Run [test](test) to run the small number of test cases, or [run](run) for an interactive REPL.
